# TIPL Membership Benefits

We ask projects that use the TIPL toolkit to send 5% of a newly minted token supply to the TIPL treasury. This qualifies the project for current and future membership benefits.

## Governance

The new tokens will increase in value as we add governance to control the distribution of tokens. TIPL will deliver tools and services to move your project through these phases:

0- The project treasury is controlled by a single benevolent dictator.

1- The treasury has a cosigner from TIPL with a 2 of 2 signing requirement. This is a minimal step to prevent dumping and make the token tradable. It is a standard option in the setup scripts. The TIPL team manages a multisig to handle this role as a second signer.

2- The treasury has a set of at least three qualified signers with at least 2 required for signing. This adds redundancy, recovery, deliberation, and reputation.

3- The token distribution is stabilized with automated lockup and vesting of tokens and LP positions. We will develop contracts which can do lockup, and also allow the recipients to participate in tender offers.

4- The treasury can sign with futarchy. We will provide a futarchy implementation.

5- Rank 5 is reserved for future best practices.

## Visibility

The project will appear on the TIPL dashboard and in social channels.

## Rewards

We will send TIPL token rewards that will add diversification and liquidity to the new treasury. We will implement this return of value as soon as valuations stabilize.

## Tooling

### Contribution and code mining

Continuously upgraded tools and practices for gathering contributions from humans and AI, consolidating them into use cases, reviewing them, and adding them to the distributions.

### Reward distribution

Automated mechanisms for allocating rewards to contributors.

### Tender offers

Mechanisms for making and responding to a tender offer.

### Monetization

Mechanisms for adding subscription benefits and collecting compensation. Compensation can be in the form of stablecoins, or a holding of the governing token.
