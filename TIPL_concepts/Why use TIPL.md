# Why use TIPL?

TIPL adds features and economics to an open source contribution process. When is it useful, and when should we stick with unadorned open source?

**TiPL fits on top of open source licensing**. The licensing source components of your system are not affected.  You can add a TIPL to give yourself some options for handling other IP.

Consider TIPL if your project is bigger than just the contributed code. It contains:

* Branding   
* Data and content  
* Internal tools  
* Business source licenses that allow contribution and debugging, but reserve commercial rights

Consider TIPL if you want to compensate contributors.

Consider TIPL if your project is expensive. It might require a lot of compute or management time. Adding some commercial features with TIPL can cover these costs.

Consider TIPL if your project wants an option to be acquired. Here are some times when that is important:

- If your project competes with a big model vendor like Anthropic, then you are forcing them into a build or buy decision. Your project will be more successful if they have a buy option.  
- If your project is in a category like DeFi that is being invaded by large TradFi companies. Your project will be more successful if they have an option to buy you, rather than compete.  
- If your project wants to tap public markets. Recently, a lot of blockchains tried to set up DATs, which would acquire a small percentage of blockchain tokens with public market funding. It is very difficult for these minority holdings to earn excess returns. A TIPL makes the entire project eligible for acquisition by a public company or SPAC, along with all of the related operating earnings.

Consider TIPL before launching an AI-themed memecoin on a platform like Virtuals or Bags. Memecoins have no value for anyone except meme traders. TIPL lets us dig in and build real IP value for everyone else.

Consider TIPL if you run a crypto project thathas a token which has limited value. You can use TIPL to add IP value to an existing token.

## How to use TIPL

Fork an existing open source project, or an internal project. TIPL gives you skills for adding a token, adding the TIPL license on top of the existing licensing, and managing the flow of contributions.

Build value by attaching proprietary IP to the same token. Include branding, data, and internal apps and tools. You can apply your TIPL to IP that is not shared. You can share IP with usage restrictions and business source licensing.
