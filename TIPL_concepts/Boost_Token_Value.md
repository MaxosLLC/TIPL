# Boost Token Value with IP Rights

Good DeFi projects can have bad tokens. The tokens don't get cash flows. They don't control enough assets to motivate an acquirer to buy them. The Tokenized IP License (TIPL) will help. It adds value to tokens by capturing the value of IP for token holders.

Abandoning IP value is expensive. It cost AAVE holders $600M. Aave protocol's front end apps, media, and branding are controlled by an independent company \- Aave Labs \- and not by AAVE token holders. This is depressing the market value of AAVE tokens.

In the worst case, you get something like [Summer.fi](https://summer.fi/). Their code is licensed from a development company "under a non-exclusive, **revocable**, fully paid-up, worldwide, non-transferable, non-sublicensable licence." The dev team can move to a competitor and kill the protocol.

## **Fix it with TIPL**

Tokenized IP License (TIPL) adds value to a token by adding a buyout right. An acquirer that makes a successful tender offer for the token gets control of the related IP.

This can fix conflicts with development companies. Often, the development company will control apps and other visible resources. A TIPL can cover ALL of the IP used by a protocol, including branding, social content, internal tools, apps, and smart contracts.

These different types of IP are used under different types of licenses. The internal tools may be exclusively for internal use by the development company. Smart contracts may be released under a business source license. etc. TIPL is compatible with all of these licenses as "initial terms".  It just says that if someone acquires enough tokens, they get to write new terms.

TIPL does not require a company or a foundation or DAO governance. TIPL just says that if someone acquires enough of the token, they get IP rights. Anyone can tag IP with a TIPL and contribute to the token, without naming a company or a foundation. Removing the legal entities improves compliance and decentralization. It avoids politics that subtracts value. It allows you to add a new TIPL to existing structures.

So,

* TIPL adds IP value to tokens  
* TIPL captures value from development companies, and any other contributors  
* TIPL is backwards compatible with existing licensing and usage restrictions  
* TIPL works without any organization. It is compatible with your existing structure, or no structure
